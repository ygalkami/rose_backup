1) 192.168.1.102

2) ICMP (0x01)

3) header = 20 bytes
   payload = total - header = 84 - 20 = 64 bytes

4) The IP datagram has not been fragmented. I determined this by looking at the flags which said More fragment: Not set

5) Identification, Time to Live, Header checksum

6) Constant: source, IP destination, IP domain pingplotter
   Must stay constant: Identification, time to live, sequence number

****7) identification 1 IP datagram packet IP

8) Identification = 0x9d7c
   TTL = 255

9) Identification changes, TTL does not

10) Yes 

11) The more fragments field is set. This is the first fragment because the
    fragment offset is 0.

12) The fragment offset is 1480. There are not more fragments because
    the More Fragments field is not set.

13) More Fragments, Header Checksum, Total Length

14) 2

15) More Fragments, Header Checksum, Total Length
