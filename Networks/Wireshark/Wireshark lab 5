1) 192.168.1.102

3) header = 20 bytes
   payload = total - header = 84 - 20 = 64 bytes

5) Identification, Time to Live, Header checksum

6) Constant: Source IP, IP destination, IP domain pingplotter
   Must stay constant: Source IP, Destination IP

7) As the time to live increases the identification increases.

8) Identification = 0x9d7c
   TTL = 255

9) Identification changes, TTL does not

10) Yes 

11) The more fragments field is set. This is the first fragment because the
    fragment offset is 0.

12) The fragment offset is 1480. There are not more fragments because
    the More Fragments field is not set.

13) More Fragments flag, Header Checksum, Total Length
