<h2>Assignment Constraints</h2>

<p>You may talk with
others about the ideas in this assignment, but you must write all code
with your partner.&nbsp; I recommend that you not split up the work, but do it 
together with the weaker programmer as &quot;driver&quot; most of the time, and with the 
driver never being willing to do things without first understanding them.  You may (and are encouraged to) 
talk to other students and get help with debugging, but do not let other 
students write the code for you.</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>You should</p>
<ul class="inline">
<li>Gain experience with reading specifications of data structures and
using them without being concerned with how they are implemented</li>
<li>Become familiar with the JDK's
<a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/docs/guide/collections/overview.html">Collections Framework</a>
included in the
<tt><a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/docs/api/java/util/package-summary.html">java.util</a></tt>
package
<li>Understand the Markov Chain algorithm for constrained random
sequence generation</li>
<li>Experience non-trivial interaction between the data structures and
the algorithm in the text-justification portion of the assignment</li>
</ul>

<h2>Your Task</h2>

<p>Your task is to implement two different algorithms, which will
be performed in sequence.</p>

<p>The first is the <a href="markov.html">Markov Chain</a> algorithm.
(Follow the link for an in-depth description.)  It takes as input some
sequence of "words" and generates as output a constrained random
sequence composed from some or all of the original "words".  The new
sequence has similar statistical properties to the original
sequence.</p>

<p>The second algorithm is a <a href="justification.html">Text
Justification</a> algorithm.  (Follow the link for an in-depth
description.)  This algorithm should take as input some intermediate
data representation from the Markov Chain algorithm and print that
data to the console so that it is both left and right justified.</p>

<h2>General Program Specification</h2>

<p>You are to write a Java application in a class named <b> <tt>Markov</tt></b>.  The&nbsp; Markov 
constructor should take 4 parameters (in the following order):</p>
<ul class="inline">
<li>The name of the text file that will be used to generate the random
text.</li>
<li>The prefix length for the Markov Chains (<i>n</i>).</li>
<li>The maximum number of words that the output should contain.</li>
<li>The maximum number of characters per output line.  This is the
justification width.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, the command</p>
<blockquote><kbd>Markov markov = new Markov(&quot;texts\\Oz.txt&quot;, 3, 400, 75);</kbd></blockquote>

<p>generates random text (written to <b>System.out</b>) based on the contents of the file
<b>
<tt>Oz.txt</tt></b> (from the texts folder) with Markov Chains of length 3.  It generates text
until the Markov Chain algorithm naturally terminates or until 400
words are generated, whichever comes first.  It justifies the output
so that each output line occupies exactly 75 characters (except the
last line).</p>

<p>Note that the above example implies that the
<tt>Markov</tt> class is in the default package, and that the Oz.txt
file is in the same folder as <b>Markov.class</b>.</p>

<p>A "word" is defined for the purpose of this algorithm as any sequence of non-whitespace
characters, so you will not need to treat punctuation or
capitalization in any special way.

<!-- I am not so sure that this statement is true
You should notice that this means
you can trivially use a
<tt><a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/docs/api/java/util/StringTokenizer.html">java.util.StringTokenizer</a></tt>
object to break an input line into "words".
-->

Thus the following will
be considered to be four different words:</p>
<ul class="inline">
<li><tt>book</tt></li>
<li><tt>Book</tt></li>
<li><tt>"Book<!--"--></tt></li>
<li><tt>book,</tt></li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Structures Specification</h2>

<p>You are required to use the data structures specified in this
document for pedagogical reasons.  Later in this course and in life you will have a
chance to choose the data structures you think best fit the problem or
implement your own, but at this point it is important to make sure you
can figure out how to use those specified here.</p>

<p>Note that this section will make more sense after you have read the in-depth descriptions of the <a href="markov.html">Markov
Chain</a> and <a href="justification.html">Text Justification</a>
algorithms.&nbsp; You should skim this document now, and read it again more carefully after reading those documents</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Current Prefix.</strong>

In your implementation of the
class that represents the current prefix, use a <tt>FixedLengthQueue</tt>
object as an instance variable that holds the actual words in the
prefix. A FixedLengthQueue should have a
constructor that takes a single argument&ndash;an integer that specifies the
length of the queue. The class needs to support a method <tt>add()</tt>.
This method should take a String as its sole argument and add it to the end (rear) of the queue.
If the queue is full, that is, if it has reached its specified length, the
<code>add()</code> method should also remove the String from the beginning (front) of
the queue in order to maintain the length. Finally the queue should
have a <tt>toString()</tt> method that returns a single String containing each entry in
the queue, from front to back, separated by a space. Whenever you move on to the next prefix during the generation
of the table of prefixes and their suffixes, you can simply add the new word
to the FixedLengthQueue to obtain the next prefix.</li>

<li><strong>Table and Table Entries.</strong> For the table of
prefixes and their associated suffixes, use a <tt><a
href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html">java.util.HashMap</a></tt>
object.  You must be sure that the keys (which should be Markov prefixes)  have a sensible
<tt>public int hashCode()</tt> method.  On pp. 232-236, Weiss has a
section entitled "Implementing <code>equals</code> and <code>hashCode</code>".  The
<tt>hashCode()</tt> example in that section should be useful to
you.  Each entry in the table (HashMap) will have a key that is a prefix and an
associated value that IS-A (or possibly HAS-A depending on what you
want to do) <tt>MultiSet</tt> that contains the
suffixes that go with the given prefix. </li>

<li><strong>Suffix Collections and Suffixes.</strong> For each prefix,
you will build the collection of its suffixes.  This collection should be
(or have) a
<tt><a href="multiset/MultiSet.html">MultiSet</a></tt>, a class that we provide. 
Adding these files to the project is described in the&nbsp;<a href="importingEclipseClasses.htm">importingEclipseClasses.htm</a> document.&nbsp;&nbsp; You 
should not
upload these files to AFS as part of your turnin; our test script will copy them into your 
turnin folder before it compiles your code.
Each item in a MultiSet will represent one suffix that corresponds
to the given prefix.  This should allow
fast insertion of new items and
fast search for the <i>K</i><sup>th</sup> item when the random
number generator tells you to use the <i>K</i><sup>th</sup> suffix.
A trivial sample
program that uses a <tt>MultiSet</tt> is included in
<a href="examples.html"><tt>examples.html</tt></a>.</li>

<li><strong>Text Justification.</strong> Use the
<tt><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html">java.util.LinkedList</a></tt>
class along with an array or <tt>ArrayList</tt> as described in
<a href="justification.html">the
Text Justification algorithm description</a>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Efficiency and Memory Use</h2>

<p>If the number of output words is small compared to the text from
which the output is constructed, we would expect that most of the
program's time would be spent building the table of prefixes and their suffixes, and not
much time producing the output.</p>

<p>It is possible that the default amount of memory allocated by the
Java interpreter will not be enough.  To increase to 100 (or substitute
your own number) megabytes, use the <tt>-Xmx</tt> option when you
invoke the interpreter: "<tt>java -Xmx100m Driver
0</tt>".  This <tt>-Xmx100m</tt> option
will also be used when we test your program.  To enter this option in Eclipse, choose Run As&rarr;Run... , 
click on Arguments.&nbsp; Under VM arguments, enter -Xmx100m.</p>

<h2>Sample Data Files</h2>

<p>Before you begin testing your program, you should create your own
small data file, designed to produce a relatively small data structure
that still provides choices for the random sequence generator.  The
words in the file do not have to make sense.  Once you are confident
that your program is working, you will want to try it on larger files
that will produce more interesting random text.</p>

<p>Some larger texts on which you may test your program are collected
in the <a href="texts/"><tt>texts</tt></a>
folder.  Due to memory requirements, you may not be able to
process the longer ones with prefix-lengths greater than two, but a
prefix length of two gives fairly interesting results.&nbsp; Try some of the 
smaller files with larger prefix lengths.</p>

<p>If you have a text that produces particularly interesting random
sentences, please send it to me, and I make it available to other students.</p>

<!--
<h2>Turnin</h2>

<p>All <tt>.java</tt>
source files from your project (and nothing else) should be copied to
<tt>/class/csse/csse230/turnin/your_username/Markov</tt> on AFS.
More details about this and about testing your completed program will be given later this week.</p>
-->

<h2>Milestones</h2>
<p>This assignment will be graded twice. For the first milestone,&nbsp; your 
code must generate appropriate Markov chained output, but that output does not 
have to be justified. Grading for this part will treat
any amount of white space in the output as a delimiter. The Markov constructor
should take the four arguments specified above, but for now it can ignore the last
argument, justification width.</p>
<p>The second milestone is the completed program, Markov plus justification. </p>

<h2>Running Your Program for Grading Purposes</h2>

<p>Our script&nbsp; will delete all <tt>.class</tt> files from your turnin folder, add in the 
two MultiSet <code>.class</code> files, and use <tt>javac
*.java</tt> to compile your code.  Then I will execute it using
a program similar to <b>Driver.java</b>.  All output from your program must be written
to <tt>System.out</tt>.  No descriptions, debugging information, or
other extra characters should be included in your output. Our program&nbsp; will
check to make sure that your output really is a justified Markov Chain, and any extra output will confuse it 
and result in loss of credit for you.</p>

<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

<p>These questions and answers will probably not make much sense if you
have not yet read the <a href="markov.html">Markov Chain</a> and <a
href="justification.html">Text Justification</a> algorithm
descriptions.  I have given a variation on this assignment before, and these
questions come from my archive of email and newsgroup questions from
that term.</p>

<th>Questions</th><th>Answers</th>

</tr><tr>

<td>How can we choose a random suffix from a
<tt>MultiSet</tt>?</td>

<td>Generate a random number, <i>k</i>, between 0 and size(), then use
the <tt>findKth</tt> method from the <tt>MultiSet</tt> class.</td>

</tr><tr>

<td>Can we assume that the length of the line being outputted is
longer than the length of the prefix?</td>

<td>I presume you mean "the first prefix".  Since that prefix contains
only one word, the answer is yes.  You may assume that no input word
is longer than the line length.</td>

</tr><tr>

<td>Is it OK to not align the right side of last line of output with the other lines or is this
mandatory?</td>

<td>It would look pretty ugly if you did! The last line should be
left-justified, of course, but definitely not right-justified (unless that 
happens naturally without adding any extra spaces).</td>

</tr><tr>

<td>Also, will the text file name given at the command prompt include
the ".txt"?</td>

<td>Yes.  Whatever the full filename is, it should be included in the call to 
the constructor.  If it's in a different directory than
<tt>Markov.class</tt>, a pathname must be given, of course.</td>

</tr><tr>

<td>Do you really mean that there should be two spaces after
<b>every</b> period, question mark, etc?</td>

<td> No.  Only if the period, question mark, or exclamation point ends a word
(defined for this assignment as a
 sequence of non-whitespace characters). </td>

</tr><tr>
<td> How do I know whether a character is a whitespace character?
</td>
<td> One approach is to use the <tt>Character.isWhiteSpace</tt>
method.  It would be very nice to set up a StringTokenizer object that
considers all whitespace characters as delimiters.  This would be
difficult if you wanted all Unicode whitespace characters; perhaps it
is easier if you restrict your attention to ASCII whitespace
characters, which you are allowed to do. Also see
<a href="examples.html">examples.html</a> for an explanation of
a <tt>String</tt>'s <tt>split</tt> method.</td>


</tr><tr>

<td>Are we ever supposed to call the <tt>hashCode()</tt> method that
we must write?</td>

<td>No.  The <tt>HashMap</tt> methods will call it when needed.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td> Can work on the justification part before the&nbsp;&nbsp; Markov algorithm 
is working?

</td> <td>
Definitely.  I suggest working on the two parts "in parallel".
 If you are working on the
justification part, you can write a very simple <tt>main()</tt> method to test
it. All
that this program must do is (like Markov) feed your justification routine a
word at a
time, so that the output routine can justify and print the words from a line
whenever that line gets filled. Your temporary program can simply bypass the 
Markov Chain part and justify the original input text.</td>

</tr><tr>
<td> What's the worst behavior my program can exhibit (this question
came from me, not from a student)?
</td><td>
An infinite loop.  You should make sure that your program always
terminates and gives some kind of output to show what it is doing,
even if that output is not correct.
</td>

</tr><tr>
<td>
What is the point of Markov, besides the DataStructures practice?
Most of our programs up to this point could have some use in the real
world.  I am just not sure what, if anything, Markov can be used for.
</td><td>
A very good question.

Let me give you an analogy.  At one point, I started taking piano
lessons.
Something I had always planned to do "when life slows down a bit." (I
finally
decided that it never will, and that if I don't do it now, I'll never
get
around to it).  Then life got REALLY busy and I gave it up, but I WILL
get back to it someday!  No, really :) <br />

What did my teacher have me spend most of my time doing?  Scales and
warm-up exercises.  I could ask "Will I ever use this in the real
world?"
What concert pianist or even bar room pianist would ever play a scale
or a warm-up exercise for an audience?
<br />
My reaction could be to say that I shouldn't have to spend time
practicing scales, etc.  because they are not "practical."
But fortunately I did not do that, and I saw that
practicing those boring pieces with &quot;no real-world application&quot; actually made me more agile at playing in general, so that I 
could play
the (quite simple) "real" pieces better than if I had
never practiced the scales.
<br >
This course is a prerequisite for many other CSSE courses.
Mostly, it its the CSSE equivalent of scales and warm-ups.  Hopefully
by the time you are done this course, you will be able to run up
and down the scales at a rapid speed, so that later when you do
applications (in Operating Systems and other courses, and presumably
after graduation), you will be able to concentrate on the problems
you are solving, because grinding out the code will now be easy.

By the end of this course I want you to be able to use data structures almost as effortlessly as a concert pianist
plays a D major scale .  If that process allows you to
do some
interesting programs with immediate applications along the way, that's
a bonus.
But it's not the only point of the programming part of this course.
