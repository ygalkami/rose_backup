<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The idea of using this algorithm came from Kernighan and Pike's
<i>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practice-Programming-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/020161586X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1200854157&sr=8-1">The
Practice of Programming</a></i>, chapter 3.</p>

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>Running the Markov algorithm with prefix length <i>n</i>=2 on the
text of L. Frank Baum's <i>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</i> might result
in something like the following.</p>

<blockquote>Dorothy lived in the doorway and looked upon her right
foot and said: "Oz has sent for you."  So the Wizard in the basket.
"Good-bye!"  "Good-bye!" shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned
upward to where the Great Oz."<!--"--> "Oh, indeed!"  exclaimed the
man.  "He has more brains than he needs."  "And I am something
terrible." "But, I don't care who kills her.  But until she is
melted," explained the Scarecrow.  He had been cut.  "There," said he;
"now you have earned the brains you will oil the joints of my legs, I
shall know everything."</blockquote>

<p>As you can see, the generated text makes little sense, but it seems to have 
similar grammar, sentence structure, and dialogue as the original 
text. It approximates natural language in structure, if not in sense. The 
generated text has similar statistical properties to the original text: every 
three-word phrase in the output appeared somewhere in the input.</p>

<p>The algorithm builds statistics about the frequency with which
words follow certain prefix groups of other words.  For example, with
prefix size <i>n</i>=1, each generated word is randomly chosen based
on the probability that it may follow the previous word, as observed
from the input text.  With <i>n</i>=2, the next generated word is
based on the previous two words, and so on.  Small values of <i>n</i>
tend to produce gibberish; large ones tend to reproduce the input
exactly.  It is possible to think of running the algorithm at
<i>n</i>=0, which would yield a truly random order of words from the input text.  
Your implementation is not required to work for <i>n</i>=0..</p>

<p>This idea of "chains" puts a few serious constraints on the
generated text.  For example, the output will always begin with the
first <i>n</i> words of the input.  Similarly, if allowed to run to
completion the algorithm will always end on the same word as the
input.  The cause of this behavior will become clear later.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>If words <i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>w</i><sub>2</sub>, ...,
<i>w<sub>n</sub></i>, <i>w<sub>n+1</sub></i> occur consecutively in
the input, then <i>w<sub>n+1</sub></i> is said to be a suffix of the
prefix <i>w</i><sub>1</sub>, <i>w</i><sub>2</sub>, ...,
<i>w<sub>n</sub></i>.  Remember, <i>n</i> is called the <b>prefix</b>
length.</p>

<p>If the same prefix-suffix pair exists <i>x</i> times in the input,
then that suffix is said to have multiplicity <i>x</i>.  Multiplicity
of the suffix is important during text generation because suffixes are
chosen according to their probability of following a given prefix as
observed from the input.  A suffix with multiplicity 2 has twice the
probability of being chosen as a suffix with multiplicity 1.</p>

<h2>Concrete Example</h2>

<p>Examine this famous passage (often called &quot;The Beatitudes&quot;)&nbsp; from the New International Version of the
Bible.  It is our input.  Notice the recurrence of certain phrases,
coupled with the uniqueness of others.</p>

<blockquote>
Blessed are the poor in spirit,<br />
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.<br />
Blessed are those who mourn,<br />
for they will be comforted.<br />
Blessed are the meek,<br />
for they will inherit the earth.<br />
Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,<br />
for they will be filled.<br />
Blessed are the merciful,<br />
for they will be shown mercy.<br />
Blessed are the pure in heart,<br />
for they will see God.<br />
Blessed are the peacemakers,<br />
for they will be called sons of God.<br />
<br />
Matthew 5:3-9
</blockquote>

<p>Let's build a table of prefixes and suffixes when <i>n</i>=2 by
considering only the prefixes that come from the first and last sentences
(otherwise the table would span several pages in this document), but we list 
corresponding
all suffixes from the passage that match those prefixes.</p>

<p>It is clear that any generated text must start with "Blessed are",
since those are the first <i>n</i> words of the input.  However, to
build our table, every word must have a prefix, and every
<i>n</i>-word phrase must have at least one suffix.  The prefixes for
the first "Blessed" and "are" spill off the front of the paragraph;
similarly, the suffix of "of God." spills off the end.  Rather than
make our algorithm's flow control more complex to handle these
boundary cases, we shall introduce artificial data.</p>

<p>Let <tt>NONWORD</tt> represent some word that is not allowed to
occur in the input.  Then consider any words that need to exist but
are outside of the paragraph to be <tt>NONWORD</tt>.  Then we can say
that the first two prefixes from this passage are "<tt>NONWORD</tt>
<tt>NONWORD</tt>" and "<tt>NONWORD</tt> Blessed".  Given prefix length
<i>n</i>, we will need <i>n</i> artificial prefixes, the first with
<i>n</i> <tt>NONWORD</tt>s, the second with <i>n</i>-1, and so on.
Similarly, we shall say the suffix of "of God." is "<tt>NONWORD</tt>".
The end result is that to begin text generation, we use a prefix of
<i>n</i> <tt>NONWORD</tt>s, and the algorithm terminates normally if
<tt>NONWORD</tt> is ever chosen as the next output word.&nbsp; In order to keep 
output from our tests from getting too long, we place an artificial limit on the 
number of generated words (this is the third parameter of the Markov 
constructor).</p>

<p>Now we can look at the table.</p>

<table border="1"><tr>
<th width="25%">Prefix</th>
<th width="25%">Suffixes</th>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>NONWORD</tt> <tt>NONWORD</tt></td>
<td>Blessed</td>
</tr><tr>
<td><tt>NONWORD</tt> Blessed</td>
<td>are</td>
</tr><tr>

<td>the (multiplicity 5)<br />those (multiplicity 2)</td>

<td><tt>NONWORD</tt></td>
</tr></table>

<p>You can see that some prefixes can lead to many different choices for the 
output text, while some have only one choice for the next word.  For example, "the poor in spirit, for theirs
is the kingdom of heaven." is a chain with no alternate branches.  However,
the prefix "Blessed are" has two possible next words,&nbsp; and "are the" has five.
Also notice that "the" follows "Blessed are" more often than "those".
Hopefully, you can now see why the first <i>n</i> words of the output
are always the same as the input.</p>

<h2>Algorithm Description</h2>

<p>Now that we've defined prefixes, suffixes, and <tt>NONWORD</tt>, we
can give pseudo-code for the Markov Chain algorithm.  Note that there
are no special cases in the flow control; the <tt>NONWORD</tt> data
takes care of that.</p>

<pre>
// build data structures
<b>w[1]...w[n] = NONWORD...NONWORD;</b> // beginning of input text
<b>while( there are more input words ) {
   w[n+1] = next word;
   add w[n+1] to the MultiSet of suffixes of w[1]...w[n];
   w[1]...w[n] = w[2]...w[n+1];
}
add NONWORD to the MultiSet  of suffixes of w[1]...w[n];</b> // end of input text

// output new text
<b>w[1]...w[n] = NONWORD;
w[n+1] = the one suffix associated with a prefix that is all NONWORDs;</b>
<b>while( w[n+1] != NONWORD ) {
   output w[n+1];
   replace the prefix w[1]...w[n] by the prefix w[2]...w[n+1];
   w[n+1] = a randomly chosen suffix of w[1]...w[n];</b>
   /* note: The random choice should be weighted based on the
      multiplicity of each suffix. MultiSet's findKth() method takes care of this for you. */
}
</pre>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The pseudo-code makes fairly clear the procedural necessities of
the algorithm.  It should also be clear that you will need to
utilize several different data structures:</p>
<ul class="inline">
<li>to keep track of the current prefix</li>
<li>to map a prefix to a list of suffixes</li>
<li>to take multiplicity of suffixes into account</li>
</ul>

<p>Most of these design decisions have been made for you, as described&nbsp; in the
<a href="overview.html">overview document</a>.</p>
