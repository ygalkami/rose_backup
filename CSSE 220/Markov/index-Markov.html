<h2>You can get a zip file of this whole folder, including the starting code,

<p><b>Note:</b> None of the documents for this assignment can be completely&nbsp; understood until you have
read the others.  They are all inter-related.  That means that you
should probably read all of them twice before beginning your design
and coding.&nbsp;
I suggest that you quickly read this document, then the other
documents in the order listed below.  Then re-read all of them more carefully. 
</p>

<p>This is a pair-programming assignment.  You may talk with other people
about it, of course, and get help as needed, but you and your partner must do the
assignment yourself and submit it (to your turnin folder on AFS).&nbsp; Even 
though you won't use SVN to submit the program, I will provide an SVN repository 
that you and your partner can use if you wish</p>

Unlike some of the recent programming assignments, your code  must <b>not</b> contain any GUI components (such as
Frame, JFrame, or JApplet). <p>



<h2>Milestones</h2>
<b>Milestone 1:</b> After reading the input, your program should produce a
correct Markov chain of words (as described in the<b> markov.html</b> document).  Line spacing does not matter, and one
word per line will be fine for your output.
<p>
<b>Milestone 2:</b>  Process the words created by the Markov chain
algorithm so that the output contains justified lines of the length
specified by the command line.

<h2> Efficiency </h2>
Minor details of efficiency are not a concern here, but the running
time should certainly be an asymptotic <b>linear function </b>of the number
of input words.  If your program takes 20 minutes to run for one of
the large files in the <b>texts</b> folder, chances are good that you have an N<sup>2</sup> 
algorithm. The first thing you might look at is how you do the input. (Note: 
recall the analysis of the <code>stringCopy</code> method from class..)
 
<h2> Documents and folders </h2>

<p>There are five main additional documents associated with this assignment:</p>

<p><a href="overview.html">overview.html</a> describes the goals of
the assignment, the four required command-line arguments, the data
structures to be used, and the submission instructions. </p>

<p><a href="markov.html">markov.html</a> describes the Markov Chain
algorithm that you are to use to generate semi-random text. </p>

<p><a href="justification.html">justification.html</a> describes the
algorithm for producing text that is left and right justified. </p>

<p><a href="examples.html">examples.html</a> gives examples of using
some of the data structures and methods that are used in this assignment.</p>
<p><a href="turnin-instructions.html">turnin-instructions.html</a> tells you how 
to submit your program</p>
<p><a href="importingEclipseClasses.html">importingEclipseClasses.html</a> tells how to get Eclipse to recognize the two <code>.class</code> files that we are providing for you.</p>


<p> <b>There are also two folders:</b>
<p><a href="multiset">multiset</a>. We are providing a MultiSet class for
you.  The multiset folder contains several useful flies:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="multiset/MultiSet.html">Multiset.html</a> provides javadoc for
the Multiset class. </li>
	<li><a href="multiset/MultiSet.class">MultiSet.class</a> is the actual
class file that you should use in your project.&nbsp;&nbsp; You should copy it to the 
place where your Eclipse project puts its .class files.</li>
	<li><a href="multiset/MultiSet$Entry.class">MultiSet$entry.class</a> is the 
class file for a nested class that MultiSet uses.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should copy it to the 
place where your Eclipse project puts its .class files.</li>
	<li><a href="multiset/TestMultiSet.java">TestMultiSet.java</a> should help
you to understand how the MultiSet class works.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The <a href="multiset/texts">texts</a> folder contains a collection of
text files that you can use as input to your program.  You may want to copy it into your project folder.  

</p>

<h2>A file to use for testing your code</h2> 
<a href="Driver.java"> Driver.java</a> contains a sample of a 
driver file similar to the one that we will use to test your code.  You can change the parameters in the 
call to the Markov constructor.<br>
<h2> Suggested process for getting started on this assignment</h2> <ul>
<li>Create a new project.
<li>Copy the two MultiSet class files and the <b>TestMultiSet.java</b> file as described  <a href="importingEclipseClasses.htm">here</a>.<li>
Copy your&nbsp; <b>FixedLengthQueue.java</b>&nbsp; and <b>Driver.java</b> files to the
project folder (in the <b>src</b> folder if your project is configured to have a 
<b>src</b> folder).&nbsp;
<li> Copy the texts folder to your&nbsp; project folder so that you will not have to use a long pathname in 
your Driver code when you
run the program.
<li> Right-click the project folder and choose Refresh so that the new files 
will be recognized.
<li> Create the other class or classes that you need.
<li> <code>do {compile; execute; debug;} while (!programIsWorking);</code>
</li></ul>

<h2> Why can't I just do it my way? </h2>

Why do you have to use the data structures that I specify, instead of
simply writing the program "from scratch"? 
<p> Some of the later assignments in the Fundamentals classes will leave more of the design
decisions to you, but others will not.  It is important to get practice in implementing other people's
specifications and designs, and using classes that are provided for you.</p>

<h2> Planning and scheduling your work </h2>

Completing this assignment on time will&nbsp; require starting early.&nbsp; 
assignment has a tighter schedule than most.&nbsp; It is important that you 
start early.&nbsp; For each of the two Milestones, it will take you a little 
while to understand what it is all about and what you should do.&nbsp; Then you 
will probably need some planning time before you begin coding.&nbsp;&nbsp; For 
Milestone I, you should do the understanding and planning parts on the day it is 
assigned, so you can begin coding in earnest the next day.&nbsp; 
<p>Milestone 1 is due on Day 22, but you should aim to complete it by Friday, so 
that if you run into trouble you will have extra time to make up for it.&nbsp; 
Regardless, you should begin work on Milestone 2 <b>before</b> Day 22, if you 
are to complete it before it is due.&nbsp; Most of the work for Milestone 2 can 
be done independently of Milestone 1.&nbsp; There will not be another weekend 
before Milestone 2 is due.</p>
