“…Now you hold on there, Jayne Cobb! I already told you four times already; ya ain’t gettin’ it,” Kaylee stood before him as pissed off as he’d ever seen her. “You take that right back mister an’ return it!”

Jayne stared down at the t-shirts he’d just recently purchased, pouting; he liked those t-shirts—every damn one of them because the women all reminded him of his Kayleegirl, but he wasn’t telling her that because that was just sissified—and she was saying no. It was time for the puppy dog eyes; she never hesitated to use them when she wanted to buy some kind of engine part the ship needed but Mal wouldn’t pay for, so he felt that it was fair game for him to the same. Putting on his best sad eyes and pouty face, “But Babydoll,” he whined, “I need new shirts!”

She gave a half nod-shake of her head just as he noticed several unsavory types walking into the bank next to the store across the street. Kaylee had her back to them so she took no notice as she continued to lay into him, “And you can have new shirts…just not ones with naked ladies on the front! There are children—one of them ours!—on Serenity and I ain’t havin’ ‘em see you walkin’ around wearin’ porn!”

This continued along the same vein for the next several minutes while Jayne half (or less than) listened to her rant and kept one eye on the bank. She smacked his hand away when he tried to usher her along the street out of firing range should his instincts be right. Gorramit! She’s so ruttin’ obstinate that she’s worse than a gorram mule, standin’ here out in the open where she could get us shot ‘f they’s doin’ what I think they’s doin’.

He settled for moving her about twenty feet behind a parked wagon. Should provide some cover we need it, Jayne thought, feeling marginally more secure as he listened to his wife. Doc says just three more months a’ this an’ then the baby’ll be here an’ she ain’t gonna be all hostile like no more. Might even get myself sexed, eventually; he mourned the way this pregnancy had her getting all hot and bothered just long enough for him to get that way too and then she’d pass out for the night. His right hand had never been so busy.

This baby had been a happy accident; Kaylee had been on the shot and Simon explained that because of that, her hormones and moods were going to be somewhat extreme during the pregnancy. But did she care that he an’ the whole rest a’ the crew was all kinds a’ strung out too? No. It was just all about her.

“Jayne!”

He started out of his thoughts to stare down at his wife, her face one huge storm cloud. Uh oh, he thought, I missed somethin’, he realized; somewhere along the line of half listening, he’d stopped and she’d just caught him. He had to think fast, “Uh, I’m real sorry, Babygirl, but I were distracted in tryin’ ta remember if’n strawberries were in season here so I could get some for my favorite girl. Ya know, just as soon ‘s I take these shirts back an’ get some new ones,” he held up the bag for good measure, relieved to see her face relent a bit.

She rolled her eyes at him, thoroughly irritated, but at least he was returning the shirts, “Well, yes, you are; but we already settled that. Now, we need to head on over to Mr. Jones scrap yard so I—Mmmph!”

Just then, the five guys Jayne had been keeping an eye out for ran out of the bank, guns drawn and he did the first thing he could think of—which would not have been advisable under normal circumstances—he kissed her.

Really, really kissed her. And it worked.

In half a second Kaylee’s arms wrapped around his neck and her tongue rushed out to meet his as they indecently ate at each other’s mouths. So distracted was she, that she didn’t notice when he quickly, but carefully, lowered them both to the ground behind the cart just as the shooting started.

She didn’t even notice the shooting at all.

Minutes later, they pulled apart, breathing hard and bodies afire. His voice rough and gravelly with keeping himself in check, he touched her face tenderly, “You wanna head back to the ship for a bit, Babydoll? Maybe get some time in ‘fore Zoe an’ ‘Nara get back with all the kids?” His eyes rolled back as he felt her nuzzle, lick and suck her way along his throat, hands roaming over the rest of him.

“Uh huh,” she agreed, lustily engaged in exploring her husband; he had far too many clothes on at the moment but she could take care of that.

Reluctantly, he pulled himself to his feet and swung her up into his arms as she giggled, holding up his shirts bag, “You’re still takin’ these back, ya know and buyin’ me strawberries if they have ‘em,” she finished on a gasp as he nibbled on her ear as he carried her.

“Yes, ma’am,” he mumbled, his tongue finding that spot behind her ear that instantly made her wet, and eliciting a needy moan from her. The sound made him as hard as a rock.

Not nearly soon enough, Jayne strode into the cargo bay with Kaylee still situated high on his chest as he detoured to their bunk in the passenger dorms. Putting her down, they locked the door and in seconds, were naked. Hands, lips, tongues explored; Jayne discovered all the physical changes that had occurred in his wife since the last time they’d gotten close like this.

All too soon though, for him, she fell back on the bed, dragging him with her. Desperately, she wanted him on top, covering her with his weight and size; but with her belly, they couldn’t and he rolled her on top of him, and helped her slide him deep within her.

His breath left his body as he felt the tight, molten heat surround him, the beauty of her pregnant with his child as she began to ride him. The ecstasy on her face as she moved faster; he gripped her hips, thrusting up into her, matching her as she cried out and grunted with every thrust, her fingers clawing into his chest.

Suddenly, she arched back, grinding into him hard as she came. Watching her come was too much for him and he clenched so hard on her hips, she would have bruises tomorrow as his body tensed like a bow; tendons cording on his neck as he followed her with a great grunt.

Slowly, she fell forward and he rolled them on their sides to ease the pressure on her belly. Softly, they kissed and nuzzled each other as they enjoyed their afterglow. “I love you, Kayleegirl.”

“I love you too, Jayne,” she said dreamily, watching as he ran his fingertips lovingly over where their child lay.

Hesitantly, he looked up at her, “Um, I had a thought; ya know, since we got our girl, Jaylee as part a’ our two names, uh, an’ since this’n’s gonna be a boy, uh, I was thinkin’ that maybe we could name ‘im Kayne.” He looked away, shy and flushed beet red, “Whatta you think?”

Kaylee felt her heart melt and tears prick her eyes; she’d been thinking about baby names for a while now, too, but none had seemed right. This one, though, fit perfectly and she knew how hard it must have been for him to bring it up like this out of the blue; it was so unlike him.

Taking his face in her hands, she poured her love for her man as she kissed him gently on the lips. Pulling back, she sniffed, “I think that’s a perfect name Jayne; he’s a part a’ both a’ us, the best parts.”

Feeling her hormones cloud over, she smacked him on the flank, “Now let’s get up an’ head back inta town; we still got stuff ta do an’ the Cap’n’ll just get all het up ‘cause we’re late.”

Rolling onto his back as she climbed over him, he let her openly ogle him briefly before smirking and whining, “Aww, Babygirl, do we have to?”

“Yes sir, Mr. Whiny Pants! Let’s get your pi gu movin’; we got stuff ta do. You gotta get new new shirts, I need strawberries, an’ then it’s to the scrap yard!” The cheery perkiness he so loved about his wife (unless it was first thing in the morning or he was hung over) was back and it brought an answering smile to his face as he proceeded to do as told.

He wondered if he could wrangle Inara or Zoe to babysit tonight.

His mind was a whirl with all the things he was hoping to do to her later while she stood in the bay as Mal parked the mule and agreed to let her and Jayne take it; so he didn’t here her properly when she said, “C’mon Jayne! Mule’s awaitin’!”

It was out of his mouth before he could stop it, “Yeah, but you’re my gorram mule, woman, so hold up!”

Jayne, Kaylee, and Mal’s eyes all widened theatrically and all for different reasons; Jayne’s in fear for what he’d just said, Kaylee’s in shock and anger, and Mal’s in a combination of surprise, train wreck fascination, and malicious glee as he vowed to watch the fireworks—from behind the safety of a crate.

As the shouting started, Simon cautiously came out of the infirmary to see what was the matter; Mal quietly called him over to where he hid.

It was good to have a buddy in these kinds of things, Mal thought as the two men watched raptly, alternately elbowing the other for attention and pointing out the good parts, gotta have someone who can back me up when I tell this at dinner.
