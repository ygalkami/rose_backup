Grader Responses - Team 14  gerth pick

12/20/07 UML diagram (Molly Richardson)-
Which class is your main class. I'm going to assume its Window.
Does Window create a JComponent?
Square should connect to JButton and JFrame separately, not in a line.
If you have an arraylist of buttons in board, you are going to need
to inherit from JButton.
What is WindowComponent for?
Maybe you should name your classes with more information as to what
they might be doing, it will not only help me the grader, but also
you as you try to work through your code as to what does what exactly.
Feel free to email me if you have any questions or need help.

YOu should be more specific about how you will test the various phases. 
I.e., how will you know if each is correct?
Where do you actually test what happens when you left/right click various kinds of squares?
That should probably involve several stages.
I an concerned that you have too little in your schedule for 1/7 and 1/8, leaving too much to be done after that.
