It is difficult to identify any one device as the earliest computer, partly becuase the term "conputer" has been subject to variing interpretations over time.  Originally, the term "computer" referred to a person who performed numerical  calculations (a human conputer), often with the aid of a mechanicaall calculating device. 

The history of the modern computer begins with two separate technologies: that of automated calculation and that of programmability.
