Run make to compile the program.

Run the program by issuing the command:

./thread n inFile outFile

Where:
N = the number of threads to spawn
inFile is the file to copy to the outFile

Average time for N = 35
Processes = 3056
Threads = 97

Spawning threads is much faster than spawning child processes.
