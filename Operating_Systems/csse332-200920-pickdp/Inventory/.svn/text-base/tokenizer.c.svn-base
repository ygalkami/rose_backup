/* This program is an example on how to use the "strtok"
function.  

Prototype:
char *  strtok ( const char * string, const char * delimiters ); 

Library: string.h

Description:
If string is not NULL, the function scans string for the first
occurrence of any character included in delimiters. If it is 
found, the function overwrites the delimiter in string with a 
null-character and returns a pointer to the token, i.e.
the part of the scanned string previous to the delimiter.
After a first call to strtok, the function may be called 
with NULL as the string parameter, and it will continue from 
where the last call to strtok found a delimiter. Delimiters
may vary from a call to another.

Return Value:
A pointer to the last token found in string.   NULL is 
returned when there are no more tokens to be found.
