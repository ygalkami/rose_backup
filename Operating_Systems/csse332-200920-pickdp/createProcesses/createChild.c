/* createChild.c 

   This program creates a child process using the fork() system call. 

   In theory, every time the program is executed, the behavior of the
   program could be different.  The execution of the two processes
   could be interleaved, and in general it is not possible to predict
   how.  However, in practice, one of the processes will always run to
   completion before the other one is allocated to the processor
   because both processes run very quickly.
