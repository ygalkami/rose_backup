Bugs fixed (all in add method, 4 pts. each):

	____ reversed arguments in constructor call for negate

  ____ …new_cents <= -100…  // was <

  ____ …new_euros = new_euros + 1 // was -

Bag.java

_-10_ Invariants added (20 pts.)

Missing contents != null and contents.owner == this.




Pre- and post-conditions for every method (1 pt. each): 
                pre    post
  Bag(int[])    ____   _-1_ no constraint on contents of contents
  Bag()         _-1_   _-1_
  removeOnce    ____   _-1_ no constraint on contents of contents
  removeAll     ____   _-1_ no constraint on contents of contents
  getCount      _-1_   ____ over-constrained contents.length
  add(int)      ____   _-1_ no constraint on contents of contents
  add(Bag)      ____   _-1_ no constraint on contents of contents
  add(int[])    ____   _-1_ missing
  Bag(Bag)      ____   _-1_ no constraint on contents of contents
  arraycopy     ____   _-1_ no constraint on contents of contents
  
  
Bugs fixed (4 pts. each):

  _-4_ (in removeOnce) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)  // was <=
  _-4_ (in removeAll) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)  // was <=
  _-4_ (in getCount) for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)  // was <=
  _-4_ (in add(int)) need to handle array of length 0, doubling doesn't
                     help with that
  _-4_ (in add(Bag)) arraycopy(b.contents, 0, new_contents, n  , b.n); 
                     // was:                                n+1
  _-4_ (in Bag(Bag)) this is a constructor, need to call no-arg constructor 
                     before adding
